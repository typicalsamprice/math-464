\maketitle

Let $C_{0} = [0, 1]$, and define a sequence of sets by
\[ C_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{3}C_{n} \cup \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{3}C_{n}. \]
That is, remove the middle third of every closed interval each iteration.
Call $\CA = C_{\infty}$ or equivalently $\cap C_{i}$ for all $i \in \NN$.

\begin{enumerate}[start=1,label={\arabic*\rparen}]
  \item Sketch $C_{n}$ for $n \le 4$. (Picture hopefully included, I decided to write out intervals for $C_{4}$ because OH MY)
  \item Show $\CA$ is uncountable.
  \item Show $\CA$ has measure zero.
\end{enumerate}

For the first, here's the picture:

For the second, suppose that $\CA = \set{ a_{1}, \ldots }$ and is countable.
Then, $a_{1} \in C_{1}$
\footnote{or go until we do have one such $a_{k}$, but we assume throughout we can always find the ``next'' one where desired}
and so either $a_{1} \in [0, 1/3]$ or $a_{1} \in [2/3, 1]$.
Choose the interval $a_{1}$ is \textbf{not} included within, and call it $I_{1}$.
Then, $a_{2} \in I_{1}$ and so without loss of generality
either $a_{2} \in [0,1/9]$ or $a_{2} \in [2/9, 1/3]$.
Again, call the interval it is \textbf{not} within $I_{2}$.
We then have a sequence
\[ I_{1} \supset I_{2} \supset \cdots \]
where $a_{k} \notin I_{k}$.
However, there must still be some $x \in \cap I_{n}$ since it is the intersection of nested closed
intervals\footnote{Failed to prove this in 301} that \emph{isn't} inside of $\CA$ which is
obviously contradictory. So, $\CA$ is uncountable.

Finally we want to show that $\CA$ has measure zero.
Let us first consider the sequence of measures of the $C_{n}$ in our construction:
\[
  \set{ m(C_{0}), m(C_{1}), m(C_{2}), \ldots }
  =
  \set{ 1, 2/3, 4/9, \ldots }.
\]
By being careful, we can see that $C_{k}$ has measure $\pars{2/3}^{k}$.
Since $\CA$ is the \emph{intersection} of all these sets, it cannot have a measure
greater than the infimum of this sequence. However, $\pars{2/3}^{k} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$
and so $\CA$ has to have zero measure exactly.
