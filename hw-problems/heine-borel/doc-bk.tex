\begin{theorem}
  If $(X, d)$ is a compact metric space then $X$ is closed and bounded.
  Furthermore, if $X \subseteq \RR[n]$ then $X$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[If $X$ is compact, then it is closed and bounded]
  Let $X$ be compact, and fix $a \in X$. Then, cover with
  \[ B_{k} = \set{ x \in X | d(a, x) < k } \]
  for all $k \in \NN$.
  This open cover can then be reduced to a finite cover, with $m$ being the largest-indexed open set.
  This $B_{m}$ contains $B_{n}$ for $n < m$ and so must contain all of $X$. So, $X$ is bounded.

  Suppose now that $X$ is not closed, and so there is some $y \notin X$ that is a limit point.
  Take the open cover:
  \[ C_{r} = \set{ x \in X | d(x, y) > r } \]
  for all $r \in \RR$. Notice that each of these sets are the complements of closed balls, and so are open themselves.
  Choose finitely many to cover $X$. Then we may pick the smallest index again, say $\delta$.
  So, if we have a sequence $\set{x_{m}} \in X$ so that $x_{m} \to y$, not all $x_{i}$ are contained in our finite cover.
  This is because for $\eps < \delta$, we cannot find any $x \in \cup C_{i}$ so that $d(x, y) < \eps$ by definition.
\end{proof}
