Find a function $f \from \RR[n] \to \RR[m]$ with $n, m \ge 2$ so that $f$ is $C^{2}$ but not $C^{3}$.

Let $A(x) = \frac{1}{2}\int x\abs{x}$. This function is $C^{2}$, as its derivative is the absolute value's integral, and so the second derivative is the absolute value itself.
It is not $C^{3}$ however, since $A$ is not thrice differentiable. Let $f(x, y) = (A(x), A(y))$. Since each component of $f$ is $C^{2}$, it must be as well.
Same reasoning for it to not be $C^{3}$ follows.
