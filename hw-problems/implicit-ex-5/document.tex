Let $f, g \from \RR[3] \to \RR$ be of class $C^{1}$.
``In general'', $f(x, y, z) = 0$ and likewise for $g$ form smooth surfaces,
and their intersection is a smooth curve.
If $\vec{x} \in \RR[3]$ is a solution to both, and $\partial(f, g)/\partial(x, y, z)$ is rank 2, then
near $\vec{x}$ one can solve the equations for two of $x, y, z$ in terms of the third,
giving a locally parametrized curve of the solution set.

\begin{proof}
  Given $f, g$ that satisfy our hypotheses and some common solution $(x, y, z) = \vec{v} \in \RR[3]$.
  We create the function $h \from \RR[3] \to \RR[2]$ by $\vec{a} \mapsto (f(\vec{a}), g(\vec{a}))$.

  Note that $\D h$ is given by
  \[ \begin{bmatrix}
    \partial_1f & \partial_2f & \partial_3f\\
    \partial_1g & \partial_2g & \partial_3g\\
  \end{bmatrix} \]
  has rank 2 by hypothesis.
  We know that \emph{some} minor of $\D h$ must be nonsingular at $\vec{v}$, and so without loss of generality we assume it is the minor
  \[ \begin{bmatrix}
    \partial_{2} f & \partial_{3} f\\
    \partial_{2} g & \partial_{3} g\\
  \end{bmatrix} \]

  This means by the implicit function theorem there is a function $\phi \from \RR \to \RR[2]$
  such that $\phi(x) = (y, z)$ and $h(x, \phi(x)) = 0$ on some open neighborhood $B \subset \RR$ around $x$.
  This means that we have a parametrized curve in terms of $x$ that is a
  \emph{common solution set} for both $f$ and $g$ with $x \mapsto f(x, \phi(x)) = g(x, \phi(x)) = 0$.
\end{proof}
