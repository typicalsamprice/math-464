\begin{lemma}\label{lem:lem-1}
  If a sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\RR[k]$ is Cauchy, then each component sequence is Cauchy.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $(a_{n})$ be such a Cauchy sequence in the supremum norm (as $\norm{\indet}$ will represent throughout.)
  Suppose some component $a_{n,i}$ for some $1 \le i \le k$ is \emph{not} Cauchy and let $N$ be large enough
  that the Cauchy condition holds for $n > m > N$.
  Then, we would have
  \[
    \norm*{\begin{bmatrix} a_{n,1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{n, k}\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} a_{m,1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{m,k} \end{bmatrix}}
    = \norm*{\begin{bmatrix}a_{n,1} - a_{m,1} \\ \vdots \\ a_{n,k} - a_{m,k}\end{bmatrix}} < \eps.
  \]
  However by virtue of what the supremum norm measures, we know that there exist $n, m$ so that
  \[ \norm{\vec{a}_{n} - \vec{a}_{m}} < \eps \le \abs{a_{n,i} - a_{m,i}} \]
  which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Any Cauchy sequence $(a_{n})$ in $\RR[k]$ converges in $\RR[k]$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $(a_{n})$ be Cauchy in $\RR[k]$, and we assume $k \ge 2$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:lem-1} we know that each $a_{n,i}$ are Cauchy, and as such each must converge
  to some well-defined value in $\bbR$. Call each $a_{n,i} \to x_{i}$ and create the vector
  \[ \vec{x} = (x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}). \]
  We claim that $(a_{n}) \to \vec{x}$, and let $\eps > 0$.
  Since each vector component converges, they each have some integer called $N_{i}$ such that for $n > N_{i}$
  there is \[ \abs{a_{n,i} - x_{i}} < \eps \] for a given $\eps > 0$.
  Pick $N = \max_{i} N_{i}$ and notice that each component is still sufficiently close to its corresponding $x_{i}$.
  Then, we notice for $n > N$
  \[ \norm{\vec{a}_{n} - \vec{x}}=
    \norm*{\begin{bmatrix}
      a_{n,1} - x_{1}\\
      \vdots \\
      a_{n,k} - x_{k}
    \end{bmatrix}} = \max\set*{\abs{a_{n,i} - x_{i}}} < \eps.
  \]
  Hence, $(a_{n}) \to \vec{x}$.
\end{proof}
